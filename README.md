# wp-fareharbor-event-list
Basic Wordpress plugin that displays the next 5 classes from the Green Valley Range calendar feed

This plugin retrieves the next 5 Concealed Carry classes (CCW) at Green Valley Range, Henderson, Nevada's only indoor gun range (and incidentally, the nicest).

Using Axios to retrieve results and a shortcode to display them, you can present users with a very classy list of upcoming events.

Future development would include the ability to use YOUR calendar instead of ours, choose the number of classes to retrieve, filter results by category, turn on/off details like Image, Description, Price, etc, and switch between List and Grid presentation.

Thanks for shopping by!
