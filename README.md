# wp-fareharbor-event-list
Basic Wordpress plugin that displays the next 5 classes from the Green Valley Range calendar feed

This plugin retrieves the next 5 Concealed Carry classes (CCW) at Green Valley Range, Henderson, Nevada's only indoor gun range (and incidentally, the nicest).

Using Axios and a shortcode, you can drop a shortcode anywhere you want to display our upcoming class list.

Future development would include the ability to use YOUR calendar instead of ours, choose the number of classes to retrieve, filter results by category, turn on/off details like Image, Description, Price, etc, and switch between List and Grid presentation.

Thanks for shopping by!
